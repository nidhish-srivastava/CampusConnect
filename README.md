## CampusConnect

### Problem Statement 
In the era of numerous social media platforms, it has become challenging to track all the platforms where a person has a profile. This is particularly true for new college students who want to connect with their peers and seniors and view their GitHub profiles, LeetCode profiles, emails, LinkedIn, and more.

### Solution
CampusConnect offers a one-stop solution to this problem by enabling students to create profiles where they can list their social media accounts, email, and college information. This platform allows students to explore profiles from different colleges, search for others, and easily connect with them.

### Why CampusConnect?
There is no need to create yet another social media platform when there are already countless major platforms with millions of daily active users. Instead, CampusConnect aims to streamline the process of connecting with college students by providing a centralized place to access and explore their social profiles.
